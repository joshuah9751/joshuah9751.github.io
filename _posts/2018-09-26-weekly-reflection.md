I realize that Code is supposed to be treated delicately because it is very delicate, it isn't like talking to a person, where a person understands a joke or something, if you are talking to a robot, it won't know that you are joking... It takes it literal and actually puts in the code what I put in. So this is the reason why you have to make sure to put in the code correctly by re-reading what you put in to see if it is correct or not. I feel like class is very good because the teacher makes us go step by step until we all understand it, he doesn't just make us do the work thinking we already know, we wants us all to know by explaining to us what is going on and what we are supposed to do and he doesn't hesitate to explain over again for a student, I think that shows that he is a very good teacher that actually wants to teach us how to code. One thing I struggle with in class is that sometimes the teacher tells us to do something, but sometimes wouldn't know where to put in the code. I want to work on fixing this problem so this doesn't happen to me again. By doing that I will try to remember where to put the code in next time since I already learned how to put the code in correctly, all I need to do now is remember this important detail.
