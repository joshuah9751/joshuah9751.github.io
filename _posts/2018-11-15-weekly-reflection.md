This week we have been focusing on listing and recording different species and gender and race and how many legs this animal would have, for example to record an animal, I will use some data and show you what I mean.
***
Sasha	cat	female	1	FALSE	4	6.5	3	
Mittens	cat	female	2	TRUE	4	7.4	1	
Sunflower	cat	female	5	TRUE	4	8.1	6	
Sheba	cat	female	7	TRUE	4	8.4	6	
Felix	cat	male	16	TRUE	4	9.2	5	
***

TRUE or FALSE also stands for FIXED, I never quite fully understood but I made a Hypothesis about what I think about it, maybe if a bone in the animals body is fixed or successfully got through a segury...
