All week we have been focusing on making and naming contracts, for example I can make any contract name like hypotenuse or right traingle. For Example, 

Range             Domain          Name
```
h-length::(leg1::Number,leg2::)->Number Number
```
or 
```
check:
  mystery("Dodgers", "Red Sox", 1) is "Red Sox"
  mystery("Dodgers", "Red Sox", 3) is "Dodgers"
end

mystery :: (team1 :: String,
            team2 :: String,
            game  :: Number) -> String 
            ```


or 
```
check: 
  mystery("Dodgers", "Red Sox", 1) is 8
  mystery("Dodgers", "Red Sox", 3) is 3
end

mystery :: (team1 :: String, 
            team2 :: String, 
            game :: Number) -> Number
```
