## Flag of Sweden by Joshua Hernandez

## Describe your program

-   I designed for the country Sweden
-   I except a grade of atleast Apprentice or Practitioner.

## Current output

-   Insert an image that your program currently produces. 

* * *
![Flag](/images/swedish-flag.png)
* * *

## Describe your process.

    Well, Instead of seperately typing down the code, I placed-image, I saw from a peer and I used that information to make my own flag, and one of my other peers had a type of blue that I was trying to look for so I asked and that is how I found the blue I was looking for.

## Explain your code.
 
BR = rectangle(width, height, "solid", "royal-blue")

YR = rectangle(width / 8, height, "solid", "gold") 

YR2 = rectangle(width, height / 5, "solid", "gold")

BR-YR2 = place-image(YR2, width / 2, height / 2, BR)

BR-YR2-YR = place-image(YR, width / 3, height / 2, BR-YR2)

-   Explain each argument in the code section. I like this 
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

* * *

```
Insert 10-15 line code section here _then delete this instruction_
```

* * *

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
